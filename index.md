The Green Shoots Community Development Trust is an attempt by me,
[@aendra.com][1], to improve the resilience and vibrancy of initiatives on the
[Bluesky][2] social media platform, focusing especially on projects and
organisations that seek to improve 2SLGBTQIA+ representation and safety.

For more information, please watch this talk I did at [AtmosphereConf 2025][3]:

&quot;Monetizing custom feeds on Bluesky could be the single most effective way
to support the growth and ongoing maintenance of community initiatives - and we
can do it today!&quot;

This site will be used to disclose all donations I make to orgs, as well as
track monthly earnings from ad revenue. Note that this is a trust and not a
non-profit; I'm currently not taking external donations and instead relying
solely on [graze.social][4] ad income to fund projects.

I'm still in the process of incorporating the Trust; suffice to say I'm a
software engineer by trade so this is sort of new territory for me. Please bear
with me as a figure this all out. ðŸ’š

My hope is that over time the trust can be a reliable source of funding for
initiatives. I know I'm starting small, but enormous trees grow from tiny
